To run main, link the following files:
	AdminFun.cpp
	Book.cpp
	GeneralFunctions.cpp
	hash.cpp
	LoadSave.cpp
	User.cpp
	UserFun.cpp
	Virtual Library Management System.cpp [main]

There are 7 different Google Tests:
	AdminTests.cpp [tests functions in AdminFun.cpp]
	ClassTests.cpp [tests various classes including book, user, hash]
	GeneralTests.cpp [tests functions in GeneralFunctions.cpp]
	integrationTest.cpp [tests all functions in library.]
	LoginTest.cpp [tests the login functionality.]
	UserTest.cpp [tests the user menu]
	UserTests.cpp [tests functions in UserFun.cpp]

Note: If you are using Visual Studio, our team found out that the main in 
Virtual Libary Management System.cpp will have to be commented out so that the Google Tests can run.
